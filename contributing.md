## üìå Organization Guidelines

1. **Forking & Cloning**
   - For external collaborators: fork the repository and clone your fork:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
     ```
   - For organization members: clone directly:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/nexatech-rwanda/repo-name.git
     ```

2. **Branches**
   - Always create a branch for your work.  
     Naming convention:
     ```
     feature/short-description
     bugfix/short-description
     hotfix/short-description
     ```
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/add-login-page
     ```

3. **Making Changes**
   - Write clear, concise commits:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add login page with validation"
     ```
   - Pull the latest changes from main before pushing:
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

4. **Pushing Changes**
   - Push your branch to the organization repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/add-login-page
     ```

5. **Creating a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Navigate to the repo on GitHub
   - Click **‚ÄúCompare & pull request‚Äù**
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Assign reviewers if needed
   - Add relevant labels (`feature`, `bugfix`, `documentation`, etc.)
   - Once approved, a team member will merge it into **main**.

6. **Code Review**
   - All PRs must be reviewed by at least one other team member.
   - Keep discussions professional and constructive.

7. **Commit & PR Best Practices**
   - Commit often, but in logical chunks
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Reference issues if applicable (`Fixes #issue-number`)
   - Ensure your code follows the project‚Äôs style guides

8. **Testing**
   - Run all tests locally before submitting a PR
   - Make sure your changes do not break existing functionality

9. **Communication**
   - For questions or guidance, use the organization‚Äôs Slack/Discord or email: `contact@nexatech.rw`
